-Author: Thomas Shetler

-purpose: to move text files from a source folder to a destination folder and make a log database of the file name
	  and the date it was last modified. the main purpose is not usefulness but simply a way to prove I know my stuff!

-How to use?: the source button selects the source folder the second browse button selects the destination folder
              Then push "check files" the program then moves the txt files from the source to the destination folder 
	      and it creates a data base of all the files you've moved! 
	      which you can look at through the SQLite database browser!
